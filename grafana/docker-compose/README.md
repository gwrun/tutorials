How to self-host Grafana on local server or VM, 
and provide a secure authenticated access to it over the internet using [gw.run](https://gw.run). 

1. [Create a new tunnel](https://gw.run/admin) and store its tunnel secrets file into `secrets/tunnel.json`

2. Run Grafana
```
$ docker-compose up --build
```

3. Open the tunnel URL and you should see Grafana welcome screen
Do additional sign in with default admin/admin password to change default administration credentials
and create more users with creation rights.
